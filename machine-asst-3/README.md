# Machine Assignment 3 - Derivation
## Purpose

This program demonstrates:

- How finite differences can approximate derivatives
- The effects of **step size h** on approximation accuracy
- How **floating-point precision limits** affect results as `h → 0`

---

## Usage
No inputs are required — all values are hardcoded.
```bash
python derivation.py
```
